# musicAnalyzer

Ideas:
- Utilize Spotify API to grab characteristics and use them for high-level analysis
- Extend with audio file analysis to do more/custom/comparative analysis 'by hand'


Spotify API is useful for Spotify-backend applications, but their track information is basic/limited, and does not yield much interesting data.

Interestingly, it does not seem that characteristics like valence, tempo, etc. affect popularity as expected.

(Obviously) analyzing audio directly allows for maximum insight and control.

# musicAnalyzer

Ideas:
- Utilize Spotify API to grab characteristics and use them for high-level analysis
- Extend with audio file analysis to do more/custom/comparative analysis 'by hand'

Spotify API is useful for Spotify-backend applications, but their track information is basic/limited.
(Obviously) analyzing audio directly allows for maximum insight and control.
